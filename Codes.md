# Code API

You can run javascript when right clicking code blocks and press to code boards.
This is only available to owners of worlds lobbies.
The javascript can interact with the Bloxd.io game api.

Please use [our discord](https://discord.gg/vwMp5y25RX) to report any issues you come across or features you'd like to see added.

## Code Blocks

- World owners can find these by searching in the creative menu
- No need to add `press to code`, this text is only needed for code boards, and will automatically be removed
- If you want to run code without opening the code editor, you can trigger the code block by right clicking an adjacent `press to code` board instead
