# Codes

This is a collection of codes which i have either made or found, all placed here,
they are split into 3 parts
- Code Blocks, codes which only needs a code block
- World Code, codes which live in world code, and may also need code blocks to function
- Board Code, uses of `press to ...` signs to make codes
in each of these, they will have a title and code attached, each code is unrelated to another unless stated otherwise

## Code Blocks

## World Code
### Timer \(1000 seconds\)

function tick(dt){
  if(Date.now()-a>1000){

  }
}
```
